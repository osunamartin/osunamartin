# Who am I?
 ### My name is Martin and I'm a 27 year old developer from Buenos Aires. I speak Spanish and English, while my favourite programming languages are Python and Javascript, and also love everything related with SQL. Since I got my first computer (almost 20 years ago) I got obsessed with learning how to use every single tool my PC was offering. Everything was written in english, so I also been studying languages since then (I speak I little bit of italian as well).

# What am I studying right now?
 ### I’m currently starting my first programming year at Quilmes University while I learn how to use tools such as Git or VSCode and new programming languages through internet.
 ### Lately I've been working with HTML, CSS and Javascript, Python (vanilla and Django framework) and MySql Databases for my own projects.

# What am I looking for?
 ### I've always been passionate about software, that's why I'm looking for new challenges in order to learn how to build it and satisfy all of my company needs.

# What do I do in my free time?
 ### I'm a part-time magician as well since I was 20, probably one of the things I enjoy the most :)
